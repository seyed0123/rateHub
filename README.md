# RateHub
Welcome to our RateHub Website, a dynamic social networking platform. This application has been developed using Django and React, allowing users to interact with each other in a variety of ways, such as adding stories, making posts, following each other, and rating each other.

## Project Introduction
The RateHub Website offers several key features, including:</br></br>
- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and log in to the application. User registration and authentication is handled by Django's built-in authentication system.</br>
- Posting Messages: Users can create posts that will be visible to all their followers.</br>
- Following Users: Users can follow other users. Once a user follows another user, they will be able to see their posts in their feed.</br>
- Rating Users: Users can rate each other, adding another layer of interaction to the platform.</br>
- Viewing Posts: Posts are displayed in a feed format, similar to Instagram.</br>
- Adding Stories: Users can add stories, a feature that allows them to share photos and videos that vanish after 24 hours.
</br>
</br>
The back end of the application is handled by Django, a high-level Python web framework known for its "batteries included" philosophy. Django provides almost everything developers might want to do "out of the box", such as user authentication, data management, and server-side logic.</br>
The front end of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows us to create a highly interactive and responsive user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.</br>

## To get a development environment running:
Provide a step-by-step guide on how to get a development environment running. This will likely include cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and setting up a database.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/seyed0123/OXDgram.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory with `cd OXDgram`.
3. Install the JavaScript dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Migrate the database using `python manage.py migrate`.

## To run the application:
Explain how to start your application. For a Django and React application, this might involve running the Django server and the React development server.

1. Start the Django server with `python manage.py runserver`.
2. In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory with `cd frontend`.
3. Start the React development server with `npm start`
